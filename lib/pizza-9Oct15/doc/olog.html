<H3>olog tool 
</H3>
<P><B>Purpose:</B>
</P>
<P>Read other log files (ChemCell, SPPARKS, SPARTA) and extract time-series data.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Read one or more log files from other programs (besides LAMMPS) and
combine their species statistical data into long, named vectors
(versus time).  The vectors can be used in Python for further
processing and plotting, or they can be output to a file.
</P>
<P>This tool will work from log files from the Sandia ChemCell, SPPARKS,
and SPARTA packages.  For LAMMPS log files, see the <A HREF = "log.html">log</A>
tool.
</P>
<P>The only difference between the log files of those programs, so far as
this tool is concerned is the line that delimits the start of the
sections that contain time-series data.  This can be set via the
second argument in the constructor, as documented below.  For ChemCell
and SPARTA, the default string "Step" can be used.  For SPPARKS, the
string "Time" will work.  Note that SPARTA can change the text in the
line that starts a section of time-series data.  In this case a start
string specific to the log file must be used.
</P>
<P>The log constructor reads one or more log files.  The names of these
one or more files are listed in the 1st argument.  The 2nd argument is
a string with text that begins the line that delimits the start of
sections that contain time-series data, as explained above.  If a 3rd
argument is specified, then a single file should be specified as the
1st argument, and it is assumed to contain data for multiple runs,
which are averaged.
</P>
<P>The nvec, nlen, and names values give the # of vectors, their length,
and names.  The get() method returns one of more vectors as a Python
list.  The write() method outputs the numeric vectors to a file.
</P>
<P><B>Usage:</B>
</P>
<PRE>o = olog("file1")                    read in one or more log files
o = olog("log1 log2.gz")             can be gzipped
o = olog("file*")                    wildcard expands to multiple files
o = olog("log.spparks","Time")       2nd arg = start string for time section
o = olog("log.cell","",0)            3rd arg = average all runs 
</PRE>
<PRE>  incomplete and duplicate thermo entries are deleted
  if specify 2nd arg, it delimits a time section
  no 2nd arg or empty string, use default = "Step"
  if specify any 3rd arg, average all runs, assume all start at time 0 
</PRE>
<PRE>nvec = o.nvec                        # of vectors of thermo info
nlen = o.nlen                        length of each vectors
names = o.names                      list of vector names
a,b,... = o.get("A","B",...)         return one or more vectors of values
o.write("file.txt")	 	     write all vectors to a file
o.write("file.txt","A","B",...)      write listed vectors to a file 
</PRE>
<PRE>  get and write allow abbreviated (uniquely) vector names
