<H3>sdata tool 
</H3>
<P><B>Purpose:</B>
</P>
<P>Read, create, manipulate SPARTA surf files.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The cdata tool reads and writes <A HREF = "http://sparta.sandia.gov">SPARTA</A> data files which
contain surface element information.  It enables the creation of
geometric surface objects for input to SPARTA.
</P>


<P>The sdata constructor reads in the specified SPARTA surface file.
With no argument, an empty sdata object is created which can have
objects added to it later, and then be written out.
</P>
<P>An sdata object contains one or more "objects".  Each object has a
unique user-assigned ID.  2d objects are made of points and line
segments.  3d objects are made of points and triangles.  When objects
are written to a SPARTA surface file, the list of points and lines or
triangles are all that is written.  The IDs are not written, though a
SPARTA command assigns its own ID to the surface file.
</P>
<P>The circle(), rect(), tri(), and spikycircle() methods create 2d
objects, namely a circle, rectangle, triangle, and spiky circle.  The
latter is intially a perfect circle with each of its points displaced
to random radial positions from Rmin to Rmax.  The seed variable can
be be set to seed the random number generator in a reproducible manner
if desired.
</P>
<P>The sphere(), box(), and spikysphere() methods create 3d objects,
namely a sphere, rectangular box, and spiky sphere.  The latter is
intially a perfect sphere with each of its points displaced to random
radial positions from Rmin to Rmax.  The seed variable can be be set
to seed the random number generator in a reproducible manner if
desired.
</P>
<P>The surf2d() and surf3d() methods create arbitrary 2d or 3d surface
objects from lists of points and lists of lines or triangles.  Note
that to be compatible with SPARTA, objects should be closed and
"watertight".  This means that in 2d every point has exactly 2 lines
connected to it.  In 3d, every edge bewteen 2 points is part of
exactly two triangles.
</P>
<P>The center(), trans(), rotate(), and scale() methods are used to
perform a geometric transformation on the points of an object.  The
union() method creates a new object with a new ID from a list of
objects.  The delete(), rename(), and copy() methods manipulate the
IDs of previously defined objects.
</P>
<P>Be default all objects are selected when created.  The select() and
unselect() methods can be used to select a subset of existing objects.
The write() and append() methods write out selected objects to a file.
</P>
<P>The iterator() and viz() methods are called by Pizza.py tools that
visualize objects and particles (e.g. gl, raster, svg tools).  Only
selected objects are returned to the caller.  A sdata file can be
visualzed similarly to a snapshots from a dump file.  In the case of
an sdata file, there is only a single snapshot with index 0.
</P>
<P>The grid() method can be used to define a 2d or 3d regular grid of
lines that will be included in the output when the viz() method is
called by other Pizza.py tools.  This can correspond to the grid used
by SPARTA to track particle motion.
</P>
<P><B>Usage:</B>
</P>
<PRE>s = sdata()			   create a surf data object
s = sdata(ID,"mem.surf")           read in one or more SPARTA surf files
s = sdata(ID,"mem.part.gz mem.surf")  can be gzipped
s = sdata(ID,"mem.*")		   wildcard expands to multiple files
s.read(ID,"mem.surf")		   read in one or more data files 
</PRE>
<PRE>  all surf data in files becomes one surf with ID
  surf files contain the following kinds of entries in SPARTA format
    points and lines (for 2d), points and triangles (for 3d)
  read() has same argument options as constructor 
</PRE>
<PRE>s.seed = 48379                     set random # seed (def = 12345)
s.circle(ID,x,y,r,n)               create a 2d circle with N lines and ID
s.rect(ID,x1,y1,x2,y2,nx,ny)       create a 2d rect, 2 corner pts, Nx,Ny segs 
s.tri(ID,x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,n1,n2,n3)  create a 2d tri, 3 pts, N1,N2,N3 segs 
s.sphere(ID,x,y,z,r,n)		   create a 3d sphere with NxN sqs per face
s.box(ID,x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,nx,ny,nz)  3d box, 2 corner pts, Nx,Ny,Nz per face
s.spikycircle(ID,x,y,rmin,rmax,n)  2d circle, N lines, Rmin <= rad <= Rmax
s.spikysphere(ID,x,y,z,rmin,rmax,n)  3d sphere, NxN sqs, Rmin <= rad <= Rmax 
</PRE>
<PRE>  tri should be ordered so that (0,0,1) x (pt2-pt1) = outward normal
  spikycircle is same as circle, with each of N pts at random Rmin < rad < Rmax
  spikysphere is same as sphere, with each surf pt at random Rmin < rad < Rmax 
</PRE>
<PRE>s.surf2d(ID,plist,llist)           create a custom 2d surf
s.surf3d(ID,plist,tlist)           create a custom 3d surf 
</PRE>
<PRE>  each point in plist is (x,y) for 2d or (x,y,z) for 3d
  each line in llist is (i,j) for C-style indices into plist
  each triangle in tlist is (i,j,k) for C-style indices into plist 
</PRE>
<PRE>s.center(ID,x,y,z)                 set center point of surf
s.trans(ID,dx,dy,dz)   	 	   translate surf and its center point
s.rotate(ID,theta,Rx,Ry,Rz)        rotate surf by theta around R vector
s.scale(ID,sx,sy,sz)		   scale a surf around center point
s.invert(ID) 	                   invert normal direction of surf 
</PRE>
<PRE>  default center for created surfs is the x,y,z or geometric center
  default center for read-in surf is center of bounding box of all points
  rotation and scaling of surf are relative to its center point 
</PRE>
<PRE>s.join(ID,id1,id2,...)		   combine id1,id2,etc into new surf with ID
s.delete(id1,id2,...)              delete one or more surfs
s.rename(ID,IDnew)                 rename a surf
s.copy(ID,IDnew) 	           create a new surf as copy of old surf 
</PRE>
<PRE>  join does not delete id1,id2,etc
  center for joined surf becomes center of bounding box of all points 
</PRE>
<PRE>s.select(id1,id2,...)              select one or more surfs
s.select()                         select all surfs
s.unselect(id1,id2,...)            unselect one or more surfs
s.unselect()                       unselect all surfs 
</PRE>
<PRE>  selection applies to write() and viz()
  surfs are selected by default when read or created 
</PRE>
<PRE>s.write("file")			   write all selected surfs to SPARTA file
s.write("file",id1,id2,...)	   write only listed & selected surfs to file 
</PRE>
<PRE>s.grid(xlo,xhi,ylo,yhi,ny,ny)      bounding box and Nx by Ny grid
s.grid(xlo,xhi,ylo,yhi,zlo,zhi,ny,ny,nz)   ditto for 3d
s.gridfile(xlo,xhi,ylo,yhi,file)   bbox and SPARTA-formatted parent grid file
s.gridfile(xlo,xhi,ylo,yhi,zlo,zhi,file)   ditto for 3d 
</PRE>
<PRE>  grid command superpose a grid, for viz only
  also changes bounding box to xyzlo to xyzhi 
</PRE>
<PRE>index,time,flag = s.iterator(0/1)          loop over single snapshot
time,box,atoms,bonds,tris,lines = s.viz(index)   return list of viz objects 
</PRE>
<PRE>  iterator() and viz() are compatible with equivalent dump calls
  iterator() called with arg = 0 first time, with arg = 1 on subsequent calls
    index = timestep index within dump object (only 0 for data file)
    time = timestep value (only 0 for data file)
    flag = -1 when iteration is done, 1 otherwise
  viz() returns info for selected objs for specified timestep index (must be 0)
    time = 0
    box = [xlo,ylo,zlo,xhi,yhi,zhi] = bounding box
    atoms = NULL
    bonds = NULL
    tris = id,type,x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,x3,y3,z3,nx,ny,nz for each tri as 2d array
      NULL if triangles do not exist
    lines = id,type,x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2 for each line as 2d array
      NULL if lines do not exist
    types are assigned to each surf in ascending order
