vec tool :h3

[Purpose:]

Create numeric vectors from columns in file or list of vecs.

[Description:]

The vec tool creates numeric vectors that can be extracted, written to
files, or imported into other tools like "plotview"_plotview.html for
plotting.

The vec constructor takes either a file or list argument.  For a file
argument, columns of numeric data are read from the file.  Blank lines
or lines that do not start with a numeric character (0123456789.-) are
skipped.  Each column must have the same number of values.  For a list
argument, each element of the list is assumed to be a vector of values
(i.e. the list is a list of lists), as shown in the example below.

The columns of data may be accessed by number (1-N) or by name ("col1"
thru "colN").

The get() and write() methods extract the numeric vectors of data.

[Usage:]

v = vec("file1")                    read in numeric vectors from a file
v = vec(array)                      array = list of numeric vectors :pre

  skip blank lines and lines that start with non-numeric characters
  example array with 2 vecs = \[\[1,2,3,4,5\], \[10,20,30,40,50\]\]
  assigns names = "col1", "col2", etc :pre

nvec = v.nvec                       # of vectors
nlen = v.nlen		            lengths of vectors
names = v.names		            list of vector names
x,y,... = l.get(1,"col2",...)       return one or more vectors of values
l.write("file.txt")	            write all vectors to a file
l.write("file.txt","col1",7,...)    write listed vectors to a file :pre

  get and write allow abbreviated (uniquely) vector names or digits (1-Nvec) :pre
