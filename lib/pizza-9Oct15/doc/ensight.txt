ensight tool :h3

[Purpose:]

Convert LAMMPS snapshots or meshes to Ensight format.

[Description:]

The ensight tool converts atom snapshots in a LAMMPS dump or data file
or mesh data from a mesh file to the format used by the "Ensight
visualization package"_ensight.  See the "dump"_dump.html or
"mdump"_mdump.html tools for info about the format of these files and
what data they contain.

The ensight constructor takes an object that stores atom or mesh
snapshots ("dump"_dump.html, "data"_data.html) as its first argument.
The atom snapshots must have "id", "type", "x", "y", and "z" defined;
see the map() methods of those tools.

The one(), many(), and single() methods convert specific snapshots to
Ensight format and write them out.  These methods take a file prefix
as an optional first argument; the prefix "tmp" will be used if not
specified.  These methods all create a prefix.case file which is used
by Ensight to define the format and list all associated files.  One or
more prefix*.xyz files are also produced which contain atom
coordinates sorted by atom type.  If additional pairs of arguments are
specified, attributes from the shapshot data (atoms or elements) can
be written into Ensight variable files, and used by Ensight as display
attributes for the atoms or mesh elements.

[Usage:]

e = ensight(d)	     d = object with atoms or elements (dump,data,mdump)
e.change = 1         set to 1 if element nodal xyz change with time (def = 0)
e.maxtype = 10       max particle type, set if query to data will be bad :pre

e.one()
e.one("new")
e.one("cns","Centro","eng","Energy")
e.one("new","cns","Centro","eng","Energy")
                     write all snapshots as an Ensight data set
                     Ensight header file = tmp.case (no 1st arg) or new.case
                     Ensight coord file = tmp.xyz or new.xyz
                     additional pairs of args create auxiliary files:
                       tmp.cns, tmp.eng or new.cns, new.eng
                     cns,eng = column name in dump file and file name suffix
                     Centro,Energy = Ensight name for the variable :pre

e.increment()        same args as one(), but process dump out-of-core :pre

e.many()             same args as one(), but create multiple Ensight files
                     tmp0000.xyz, tmp0001.xyz, etc
                     new0000.cns, new0001.cns, etc
                     new0000.eng, new0001.eng, etc :pre

e.single(N)          same args as one() prepended by N, but write a single snap :pre
