<H3>vec tool 
</H3>
<P><B>Purpose:</B>
</P>
<P>Create numeric vectors from columns in file or list of vecs.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The vec tool creates numeric vectors that can be extracted, written to
files, or imported into other tools like <A HREF = "plotview.html">plotview</A> for
plotting.
</P>
<P>The vec constructor takes either a file or list argument.  For a file
argument, columns of numeric data are read from the file.  Blank lines
or lines that do not start with a numeric character (0123456789.-) are
skipped.  Each column must have the same number of values.  For a list
argument, each element of the list is assumed to be a vector of values
(i.e. the list is a list of lists), as shown in the example below.
</P>
<P>The columns of data may be accessed by number (1-N) or by name ("col1"
thru "colN").
</P>
<P>The get() and write() methods extract the numeric vectors of data.
</P>
<P><B>Usage:</B>
</P>
<PRE>v = vec("file1")                    read in numeric vectors from a file
v = vec(array)                      array = list of numeric vectors 
</PRE>
<PRE>  skip blank lines and lines that start with non-numeric characters
  example array with 2 vecs = [[1,2,3,4,5], [10,20,30,40,50]]
  assigns names = "col1", "col2", etc 
</PRE>
<PRE>nvec = v.nvec                       # of vectors
nlen = v.nlen		            lengths of vectors
names = v.names		            list of vector names
x,y,... = l.get(1,"col2",...)       return one or more vectors of values
l.write("file.txt")	            write all vectors to a file
l.write("file.txt","col1",7,...)    write listed vectors to a file 
</PRE>
<PRE>  get and write allow abbreviated (uniquely) vector names or digits (1-Nvec)
