<H3>cfg tool 
</H3>
<P><B>Purpose:</B>
</P>
<P>Convert LAMMPS snapshots to AtomEye CFG format.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The cfg tool converts atom snapshots in a LAMMPS dump or data file to
the CFG format used by the <A HREF = "http://164.107.79.177/Archive/Graphics/A">AtomEye</A> visualization tool.
</P>


<P>The cfg constructor takes an object that stores atom snapshots
(<A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A>, <A HREF = "data.html">data</A>) as its first argument.  The atom
snapshots must have "id", "type", "x", "y", and "z" defined; see the
map() methods of those tools.
</P>
<P>The one(), many(), and single() methods convert specific snapshots to
the CFG format and write them out.  Optionally, a file prefix for the
CFG output files can also be specified.  A ".cfg" suffix will be
appended to all output files.
</P>
<P>If your atom snapshots are not sorted by atom ID (e.g. because they
were written out by a parallel LAMMPS run), then you may want to sort
them before converting them to CFG files with this tool.  This can be
done by "d = dump("tmp.dump"); d.sort()".  This is because AtomEye
does not use atom IDs directly but infers an ID by the order of atoms
as they appear in the CFG file.
</P>
<P><B>Usage:</B>
</P>
<PRE>c = cfg(d)		d = object containing atom coords (dump, data) 
</PRE>
<PRE>c.one()                 write all snapshots to tmp.cfg
c.one("new")            write all snapshots to new.cfg
c.many()                write snapshots to tmp0000.cfg, tmp0001.cfg, etc
c.many("new")           write snapshots to new0000.cfg, new0001.cfg, etc
c.single(N)             write snapshot for timestep N to tmp.cfg 
c.single(N,"file")      write snapshot for timestep N to file.cfg
